## VolunteerHub

VolunteerHub was the final project of the **Code for All_** bootcamp. This three-day project brought together teams of four to develop a platform aimed at creating a meaningful social impact.

## Our Vision
We set out to build an app that bridges the gap between associations and volunteers. As volunteers, we often face challenges in finding associations or organizations in need of help, while associations frequently struggle to connect with potential volunteers.
**VolunteerHub** serves as the intermediary between these two groups, making it easier for both to connect and collaborate effectively.

## Key Features
- 🏢 Associations can create and post **events**.
- 🙋 Volunteers can browse events and **register directly** for opportunities.
- 🌍 Events are categorized and **organized geographically** for easy navigation.
